A new interdisciplinary SmallSat initiative at the UA includes construction of integration and test facilities as well as a CubeSat ground station. University of Arizona offers a world-class research environment in ground and space-based astrophysics with strong interdisciplinary programs across the Departments of Astronomy, Optical Sciences, Planetary Sciences, Physics, and the UA Data Science Institute. Steward Observatory provides direct access to various world-class facilities for ground-based radio and optical observing. Among these are the Large Binocular Telescope and 6.5m aperture telescopes located in both the northern and southern hemispheres.

### The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB)
To advance exoplanet imaging technologies we operate a vacuum-compatible high-contrast testbed, currently configured for visible wavelengths and featuring a 952 actuator deformable mirror.

### Prototyping and 3D printing

 UA students should feel free to contact us if they have space or astronomy related components they would like to prototype. Available equipment include a Dremel LC40 laser cutter and 3D printers, including a Dremel 3D40 and a Markforged Onyx Pro printer allow rapid prototyping.

### Optical Metrology and Testing

Our lab's 4D PhaseCam 6000 allows vibration insensitive metrology of optical systems such a space telescope assemblies as well as testing of individual optical components on nanometer scales.


### Ground-based Astronomical Observatories

Steward Observatory is a partner and home to a wide range of world-class observatories, for details see our [observatories page](observatories.md).
